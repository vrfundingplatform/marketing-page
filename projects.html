        <p>Video games can be an outlet for many kids, unfortunately not all kids have access to these types of things as they can get pricey.

            <p>Anatomy forms the foundation for much of what a medical student needs to learn and what a doctor needs to know, but it is often a dreaded memorization ordeal and a challenge to see how all the bones, muscles, nerves and organs fit together. Cadavers and textbooks have limitations in what they can convey.  <br> <a href = 'https://sixr-bw.netlify.com/'><button> Support us</button></a></p>
